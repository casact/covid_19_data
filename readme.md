# COVID-19 Data

This repository will support actuaries' interest in exploring COVID-19 data. 

If you have the `make` program, you can use it to automatically and sensibly execute the scripts in the `data` folder. If you use RStudio, you can press CTRL-SHIFT-B to run `make`. Using `make` will ensure that you do not gather data which you have already stored on your device. This will minimize processing time and server load to data providers.

We love issues and pull requests! When making them, though, please observe our [contribution guidelines](contributing.md).
